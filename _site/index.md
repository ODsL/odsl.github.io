## Goal

The ODsL - Open Dataset Licensing - project is meant to engage the data science and open source communities (in Israel, for starters) in a discussion about how to adapt and create open code and data licenses suitable for the current and future challenges of a data-driven world and to encourage their use in academia, industry and government.


## Motivation

Today, numerous datasets, and code meant to generate them, are available for every enthusiastic developer and researcher to explore. Those datasets, however, can also be used for less-than-honest ends by companies and organizations in various ways, some of which are made possible with recent advances in machine learning and related fields. On the other hand, the importance and power of large datasets is also increasing, and with them the importance of keeping them open.

However, current licenses for open code and data have not been created with explicit consideration of these scenarios.
